# How to get the Wii common key bin file for hacking
 
If you want to hack your Wii console and run homebrew games or applications, you may need to get the Wii common key bin file. This file contains a 16-byte hexadecimal code that is used to decrypt Wii ISO files and other encrypted data. Without this file, some hacking tools may not work properly.
 
There are different ways to get the Wii common key bin file, but one of the easiest methods is to use a tool called MakeKeyBin. This tool can generate the Wii common key and Korean key in the current directory. You can download MakeKeyBin from [this link](https://wiidatabase.de/downloads/pc-tools/makekeybin/) [^3^].

After downloading MakeKeyBin, extract it to a folder of your choice and run it. It will ask you to type 42 and press enter. It will then create two files: key.bin and kkey.bin. You can ignore kkey.bin, as it is only used for Korean Wiis. The key.bin file is the Wii common key bin file that you need.
 
Some hacking tools may require you to rename the key.bin file to common-key.bin or COMMON-KEY.BIN. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and selecting Rename. Make sure you save it as a .bin file type.
 
Now you have the Wii common key bin file, you can use it with various hacking tools, such as Loadstructor, WiiScrubber, or Dolphin Emulator. You may need to copy the file to a specific folder or browse for it when prompted by the tool.

Happy hacking!
  
One of the benefits of hacking your Wii is that you can play backup copies of your games from a USB drive or an SD card. This can save you from damaging your original discs or losing them. You can also play games from other regions that are not compatible with your Wii.
 
To play backup games, you need to install a custom IOS (cIOS) on your Wii. A cIOS is a modified version of the official Nintendo IOS that allows you to access the USB port and other features. You can use a tool like ModMii to download and install the cIOS of your choice.
 
After installing the cIOS, you need to use a tool like Wii Backup Manager to convert your game ISO files to WBFS format. WBFS is a file system that is optimized for Wii games and reduces their size. You can then copy the WBFS files to your USB drive or SD card using the same tool.
 
Finally, you need to use a USB loader to launch your backup games from your USB drive or SD card. A USB loader is a homebrew application that lets you browse and play your games. There are many USB loaders available, such as USB Loader GX, WiiFlow, or CFG USB Loader. You can download them from [this list](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_loaders).
  
Playing backup games is not the only thing you can do with a hacked Wii. You can also install various homebrew applications that can enhance your Wii experience. For example, you can use Homebrew Browser to download and install hundreds of homebrew apps from the internet. You can also use Priiloader to customize your Wii system menu and prevent bricking. You can also use Nintendont to play GameCube games on your Wii or Wii U.
 
Homebrew applications are not authorized by Nintendo and may void your warranty or damage your Wii. Therefore, you should always follow the instructions carefully and backup your NAND before installing anything. You should also avoid updating your Wii system software or accepting online updates from games, as they may remove your cIOS or homebrew channel.
 
Hacking your Wii can be a fun and rewarding hobby, but it also comes with some risks and responsibilities. You should always respect the intellectual property rights of the game developers and publishers and only use backup copies of games that you own legally. You should also avoid cheating or piracy online, as they may ruin the game experience for others and get you banned from Nintendo services.
